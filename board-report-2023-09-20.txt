## Description:

Apache TomEE delivers enterprise application containers and services based
on, but not limited to the Enterprise JavaBeans Specification and Java
Enterprise Edition Specifications.

## Health

Activity on the project over the last quarter has been low with just 10
commits to main in the previous three months from today (9/17).  We seem to
be steadily trending downward over the years.  Here's an analysis of commits
broken up by calendar quarter since work first started on TomEE 1.0.

The project has actively been trying to increase participation.  Users on the
user list are frequently encouraged to help and given the "every contribution
helps" perspective.

The few that have shown interest are given very warm and encouraging
responses with a great deal of coaching to feel comfortable asking questions,
not get discouraged, not be hard on themselves and are encouraged to start
small and get the encouragement a quick win before trying bigger tasks.

Despite our efforts, almost no one makes it to the point where they can
contribute to core code in any capacity.  Contributions typically stop at
minor doc updates and library upgrades.

Those that do show enough promise to make it to committer tend to not
continue contributing very long.  We've added 7 committers in the last 6
years and of that list only one contributes regularly.  Two in the list
stopped contributing once they gained the committer title, three stopped
committing in the first year.  Lowering the bar to commit hasn't really
helped.

A significant bar to entry has always been that the TCKs we implement were
restricted and not available to the public.  These were all open sourced in
2018/2019 and we had hoped this would be key in enabling more members of the
community to help with the main work of the project, getting compliance tests
to pass and shipping certified releases.  This hasn't really helped and in
fact the new faster pace at which specifications are released seems to only
hurt us.

We had reported build times as a potential deterrent (they were 4-5 hours)
and worked with Infra to help setup builds in AWS.  This was complete last
quarter.  So far we have not had any new contributors test out this new
system.

We will keep trying, but overall it seems like very few are in a position to
contribute.  There is a high bar in terms of time and experience we simply
cannot control or reduce.  Fixing one TCK test can take a very experienced
person one week full-time.  You need to research cryptic text in
specifications, do deep debugging in code you don't know to find causes, and
find intricate solutions that do not cause new failures elsewhere.  Due to
the time involved it isn't something you can do without the support of your
employer and it doesn't appear anyone who uses TomEE has interest in
investing in the project at that level.


## Activity

As mentioned above, activity has been low -- 10 commits to main in the last
90 days.  No new releases have been shipped.

The work done has largely been around the integration between TomEE and CXF,
specifically to get CXF 4.0 fully integrated.  We have seen a new face arrive
and offer to help in this area and has openend a PR to help setup the new
Jakarta REST TCK suite from Jakarta EE 10.  It's not fully working and breaks
the build, but is still very positive.  Any kind of start is a good start.
